        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            My journey to achieving the Splunk Certified Cyber Defense Analyst Certification has been a transformative experience. Having completed 10 out of the 15 required courses, I have gained critical insights into the processes and thought patterns of a Cyber Defense Analyst, particularly in threat detection, analysis, and response. As a Cyber Defense Analyst in training, I am actively learning and practicing a broad array of frameworks, attack surfaces, and defense methodologies. My focus is on building a strong foundation in these concepts to better understand and mitigate cyber threats effectively. Below is a detailed outline of my current knowledge and progress in these areas.

            <h2>Key Frameworks and Standards</h2>
            <p>
                Familiarity with cybersecurity frameworks is critical for understanding organizational security policies and threat modeling. I am currently building my understanding of the following frameworks:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CVE Program:</strong> Learning to prioritize mitigation efforts based on common vulnerabilities and exposures.</li>
                <li><strong>MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise Matrix:</strong> Studying adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to improve threat identification.</li>
                <li><strong>Pyramid of Pain:</strong> Exploring how targeting different types of adversary data can aid in effective threat detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain:</strong> Understanding the phases of a cyberattack to enhance detection and response strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>EU-GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS:</strong> Gaining awareness of regulatory compliance and secure data handling practices.</li>
                <li><strong>ISO 27000 Series and NIST CSF/RMF:</strong> Learning guidelines for managing security risks and establishing controls.</li>
                <li><strong>OWASP Top Ten:</strong> Becoming familiar with common web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Understanding and Analyzing Attack Surfaces</h2>
            <p>
                By exploring various attack surfaces, I am learning to anticipate and mitigate potential threats. My studies have included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phishing and Typesquatting:</strong> Understanding deceptive tactics used to steal credentials and sensitive information.</li>
                <li><strong>DNS Attacks:</strong> Gaining knowledge of tunneling, amplification, flooding, and spoofing techniques to defend against DNS abuse.</li>
                <li><strong>Malware and Ransomware:</strong> Learning to analyze payload behavior and defenses against spyware, adware, viruses, and trojans.</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Investigating vulnerabilities in third-party integrations to safeguard assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):</strong> Exploring how IOCs are used to detect breaches and malicious activities proactively.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Core Defense Analyst Skills</h2>
            <p>
                My growing technical understanding and analytical abilities form the basis of my defense strategies. Key skills I am working to develop include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TTP Identification:</strong> Learning to recognize adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures to anticipate and counter attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>SIEM Technologies:</strong> Building proficiency in leveraging Splunk Enterprise Security to analyze logs and generate actionable insights.</li>
                <li><strong>SOC Structure:</strong> Understanding the roles and workflows within a Security Operations Center (SOC) to streamline incident response.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                While I am still in the process of mastering these frameworks and techniques, my dedication to learning and practicing these fundamentals ensures continuous growth in my abilities as a Cyber Defense Analyst. I aim to further develop my understanding to contribute effectively to the security of organizational infrastructures.
